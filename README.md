##Welcome to the Sbdi Project!

###What is it?
Essentially, I am attempting to write a framework/api for other developers who want to easily write games in Jython(Python in Java, basically the same.) All of the heavy lifting will be handled by Java, and the simple scripted events and the new subclasses will be written in Jython. I want the API to be incredibly incredibly easy to use, without restricting the advanced users - effectively enabling other to want to write their own stories and plots easily and quickly, going into whatever depth they wish.

####What is Jython?
Its the Java implementation of Python. It keeps the easy-to-use interface of Python while also allowing to interface with Java classes and methods. You may subclass my given classes, run inherited methods, etc. When completed, Jython will be included with my program along with its other dependencies.

####What is the LWJGL?
It is the Lightweight Java Game Library, which, for the most part is autonomous. It enables me to use OpenGL, OpenCL, and OpenAL (Graphics, Computing, Audio) - which would otherwise present me with a rather difficult task of developing a game. So all-in-all, its awesome!

####What is slick?
A collection of a few other libraries that are useful for various things - mainly Textures and Fonts.
